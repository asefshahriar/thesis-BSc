\begin{enumerate}

 \item{Reduced RMSE and MAPE}
 \item{A model with low data and development costs. Especially, if the transfer learning approach show enough accuracy, the costs associated with data will be lesser than conventional models.}
 \item{A feasible model considering costs and other challenges}

\end{enumerate}
