Demand forecast has always been a vital part of supply chain. A forecasting model with adequate accuracy can increase the profit margin of the company. In a broader sense it can make the supply chain of the organization more responsive and resilient to failure. Traditional forecasting methods have been in practice for long time. These methods are based on simple arithmetic and of low accuracy. But seasonal variability, special days, e-commerce etc. have increased  the complexity of demand forecasting now-a-days. To meet this requirement researchers have applied sophisticated time series and machine learning models. These models performed better to some extent than traditional regression models. Deep learning has emerged in recent time with great potential in almost every field. The research aims to study the performance and reliability of deep learning techniques in supply chain demand forecasting.
