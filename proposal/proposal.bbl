    \field{abstract}{%
    This paper proposes a novel forecasting method that combines the deep
  learning method â€“ long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks and random
  forest ({RF}). The proposed method can model complex relationships of both
  temporal and regression type which gives it an edge in accuracy over other
  forecasting methods. We evaluated the new method on a real-world multivariate
  dataset from a multi-channel retailer. We benchmark the forecasting
  performance of the new proposition against neural networks, multiple
  regression, {ARIMAX}, {LSTM} networks, and {RF}. We employed forecasting
  performance metrics to measure bias, accuracy, and variance, and the
  empirical evidence suggests that the new proposition is (statistically)
  significantly better. Furthermore, our method ranks the explanatory variables
  in terms of their relative importance. The empirical evaluations are
  replicated for longer forecasting horizons, and online and offline channels
  and the same conclusions hold; thus, advocating for the robustness of our
  forecasting proposition as well as the suitability in multi-channel retail
  demand forecasting.%
