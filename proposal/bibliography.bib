	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel forecasting method that combines the deep learning method – long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks and random forest ({RF}). The proposed method can model complex relationships of both temporal and regression type which gives it an edge in accuracy over other forecasting methods. We evaluated the new method on a real-world multivariate dataset from a multi-channel retailer. We benchmark the forecasting performance of the new proposition against neural networks, multiple regression, {ARIMAX}, {LSTM} networks, and {RF}. We employed forecasting performance metrics to measure bias, accuracy, and variance, and the empirical evidence suggests that the new proposition is (statistically) significantly better. Furthermore, our method ranks the explanatory variables in terms of their relative importance. The empirical evaluations are replicated for longer forecasting horizons, and online and offline channels and the same conclusions hold; thus, advocating for the robustness of our forecasting proposition as well as the suitability in multi-channel retail demand forecasting.},

However, despite numerous advancements, crucial methodological issues remain unaddressed. This study aims to further improve the modeling accuracy and advance the artificial intelligence ({AI})-based tourism demand forecasting methods. Deep learning models that predict tourism demand are often highly complex and encounter overfitting, which is mainly caused by two underlying problems: (1) access to limited data volumes and (2) additional explanatory variable requirement. To address these issues, we use a decomposition method that achieves high accuracy in short- and long-term {AI}-based forecasting models. The proposed method effectively decomposes the data and increases accuracy without additional data requirement. In conclusion, this study alleviates the overfitting issue and provides a methodological contribution by proposing a highly accurate deep learning method for {AI}-based tourism demand modeling.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

One key challenge is to forecast demand on special days that are subject to vastly different demand patterns than on regular days. We present the case of a bakery chain with an emphasis on special calendar days, for which we address the problem of forecasting the daily demand for different product categories at the store level. Such forecasts are an input for production and ordering decisions. We treat the forecasting problem as a supervised machine learning task and provide an evaluation of different methods, including artificial neural networks and gradient-boosted decision trees. In particular, we outline and discuss the possibility of formulating a classification instead of a regression problem. An empirical comparison with established approaches reveals the superiority of machine learning methods, while classification-based approaches outperform regression-based approaches. We also found that machine learning methods not only provide more accurate forecasts but are also more suitable for applications in a large-scale demand forecasting scenario that often occurs in the retail industry.},

A deep learning method, the long-short-term-memory network, is used as the base forecasting method in the {CTFF}. The performance of the {CTFF} is evaluated on point-of-sales data from a large multi-channel retail supply chain. Through several performance metrics and statistical tests, we conclude that forecasts from the {CTFF} are significantly better than the direct forecasts. In addition, improvements are significant and consistent across cross-sectional and temporal levels of a supply chain. Further, it has been observed that bottom-up forecasts are more accurate than top-down forecasts when point-of-sales data is used for forecasting in online and offline retail supply chain.},

Recently, the booming development of deep learning techniques make them promising alternatives to conventional data-driven approaches. While deep learning offers exceptional capability in handling complex non-linear relationships, model complexity and computation efficiency are of concern. A few papers have explored the possibility of applying deep neural networks to forecast time-series load data but only limited to system-level or single-step building-level forecasting. This study, however, aims at filling in the knowledge gap of deep learning-based techniques for day-ahead multi-step load forecasting in commercial buildings. Two classical deep neural network models, namely recurrent neural network ({RNN}) and convolutional neural network ({CNN}), have been proposed and formulated under both recursive and direct multi-step manners. Their performances are compared with the Seasonal {ARIMAX} model with regard to accuracy, computational efficiency, generalizability and robustness. Among all of the investigated deep learning techniques, the gated 24-h {CNN} model, performed in a direct multi-step manner, proves itself to have the best performance, improving the forecasting accuracy by 22.6\% compared to that of the seasonal {ARIMAX}.},

The spatial and temporal analyses were first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern of the station-free bike sharing. The result indicates the imbalanced spatial and temporal demand of bike sharing trips. The long short-term memory neural networks ({LSTM} {NNs}) were then developed to predict the bike sharing trip production and attraction at {TAZ} for different time intervals, including the 10-min, 15-min, 20-min and 30-min intervals. The validation results suggested that the developed {LSTM} {NNs} have reasonable good prediction accuracy in trip productions and attractions for different time intervals.

The comparison results suggested that the {LSTM} {NNs} provide better prediction accuracy than both conventional statistical models and advanced machine learning methods for different time intervals.

	abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms-deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-The-Art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms {ARIMA} by 19.5\%, {SVR} by 13.1\% and classical deep {RNN} by 6.5\% in terms of {RMSE}.},

However, developing and selecting accurate time series models is a challenging task as this requires training several different models for selecting the best amongst them along with substantial feature engineering to derive informative features and finding optimal time lags, a commonly used input features for time series models. Methods: Our approach uses machine learning and a long short-term memory ({LSTM})-based neural network with various configurations to construct forecasting models for short to medium term aggregate load forecasting. The research solves above mentioned problems by training several linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms and picking the best as baseline, choosing best features using wrapper and embedded feature selection methods and finally using genetic algorithm ({GA}) to find optimal time lags and number of layers for {LSTM} model predictive performance optimization. Results: Using France metropolitan's electricity consumption data as a case study, obtained results show that {LSTM} based model has shown high accuracy then machine learning model that is optimized with hyperparameter tuning. Using the best features, optimal lags, layers and training various {LSTM} configurations further improved forecasting accuracy. Conclusions: A {LSTM} model using only optimally selected time lagged features captured all the characteristics of complex time series and showed decreased Mean Absolute Error ({MAE}) and Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) for medium to long range forecasting for a wider metropolitan area.},

	abstract = {Short-term passenger demand forecasting is of great importance to the on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependencies, temporal dependencies, and exogenous dependencies need to be considered simultaneously, however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We propose a novel deep learning ({DL}) approach, named the fusion convolutional long short-term memory network ({FCL}-Net), to address these three dependencies within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by multiple convolutional long short-term memory ({LSTM}) layers, standard {LSTM} layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and the {LSTM} network enables the proposed {DL} approach to better capture the spatio-temporal characteristics and correlations of explanatory variables. A tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection. The proposed {DL} approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China. The experimental results, validated on the real-world data provided by {DiDi} Chuxing, show that the {FCL}-Net achieves the better predictive performance than traditional approaches including both classical time-series prediction models and state-of-art machine learning algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network, {XGBoost}, {LSTM} and {CNN}). Furthermore, the consideration of exogenous variables in addition to the passenger demand itself, such as the travel time rate, time-of-day, day-of-week, and weather conditions, is proven to be promising, since they reduce the root mean squared error ({RMSE}) by 48.3\%. It is also interesting to find that the feature selection reduces 24.4\% in the training time and leads to only the 1.8\% loss in the forecasting accuracy measured by {RMSE} in the proposed model. This paper is one of the first {DL} studies to forecast the short-term passenger demand of an on-demand ride service platform by examining the spatio-temporal correlations.},

Our findings suggest that while recurrent neural networks and support vector machines show the best performance, their forecasting accuracy was not statistically significantly better than that of the regression model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Effective supply chain management is one of the key determinants of success of today's businesses. However, communication patterns between participants that emerge in a supply chain tend to distort the original consumer's demand and create high levels of noise. In this article, we compare the performance of new machine learning ({ML})-based forecasting techniques with the more traditional methods. To this end we used the data from a chocolate manufacturer, a toner cartridge manufacturer, as well as from the Statistics Canada manufacturing survey. A representative set of traditional and {ML}-based forecasting techniques have been applied to the demand data and the accuracy of the methods was compared. As a group, based on ranking, the average performance of the {ML} techniques does not outperform the traditional approaches. However, using a support vector machine ({SVM}) that is trained on multiple demand series has produced the most accurate forecasts. Copyright © 2007, {IGI} Global.},

The platform comprises of a complex end-to-end machine learning system built on Apache Spark, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, distributed learning, as well as evaluation, experimentation and ensembling. Furthermore, it meets the demands of a production system and scales to large catalogues containing millions of items. We describe the challenges of building such a platform and discuss our design decisions. We detail aspects on several levels of the system, such as a set of general distributed learning schemes, our machinery for ensembling predictions, and a high-level dataflow abstraction for modeling complex {ML} pipelines.

	abstract = {Nowadays, a large number of water utilities still manage their operation on the instant water demand of the network, meaning that the use of the equipment is conditioned by the immediate water necessity. The water reservoirs of the networks are filled using pumps that start working when the water level reaches a specified minimum, stopping when it reaches a maximum level. Shifting the focus to water management based on future demand allows use of the equipment when energy is cheaper, taking advantage of the electricity tariff in action, thus bringing significant financial savings over time. Short-term water demand forecasting is a crucial step to support decision making regarding the equipment operation management. For this purpose, forecasting methodologies are analyzed and implemented. Several machine learning methods, such as neural networks, random forests, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, are evaluated using real data from two Portuguese water utilities. Moreover, the influence of factors such as weather, seasonality, amount of data used in training and forecast window is also analysed. A weighted parallel strategy that gathers the advantages of the different machine learning techniques is suggested. The results are validated and compared with those achieved by autoregressive integrated moving average ({ARIMA}) also using benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Generating accurate and reliable sales forecasts is crucial in the E-commerce business. The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of a single product. However, in a situation where large quantities of related time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial. Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory network ({LSTM}) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product grouping strategies to supplement the {LSTM} learning schemes, in situations where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate. We empirically evaluate the proposed forecasting framework on a real-world online marketplace dataset from Walmart.com. Our method achieves competitive results on category level and super-departmental level datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {Daily {SKU} demand forecasting is a challenging task as it usually involves predicting irregular series that are characterized by intermittency and erraticness. This is particularly true when forecasting at low cross-sectional levels, such as at a store or warehouse level, or dealing with slow-moving items. Yet, accurate forecasts are necessary for supporting inventory holding and replenishment decisions. This task is typically addressed by utilizing well-established statistical methods, such as the Croston’s method and its variants. More recently, Machine Learning ({ML}) methods have been proposed as an alternative to statistical ones, but their superiority remains under question. This paper sheds some light in that direction by comparing the forecasting performance of various {ML} methods, trained both in a series-by-series and a cross-learning fashion, to that of statistical methods using a large set of real daily {SKU} demand data. Our results indicate that some {ML} methods do provide better forecasts, both in terms of accuracy and bias. Cross-learning across multiple {SKUs} has also proven to be beneficial for some of the {ML} methods.},

	abstract = {Smartgrids of the future promise unprecedented flexibility in energy management. Therefore, accurate predictions/forecasts of energy demands (loads) at individual site and aggregate level of the grid is crucial. Despite extensive research, load forecasting remains to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a load forecasting methodology based on deep learning. Specifically, the work presented in this paper investigates the effectiveness of using Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) for performing energy load forecasting at individual building level. The presented methodology uses convolutions on historical loads. The output from the convolutional operation is fed to fully connected layers together with other pertinent information. The presented methodology was implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption for a single residential customer. Results obtained from the {CNN} were compared against results obtained by Long Short Term Memories {LSTM} sequence-to-sequence ({LSTM} S2S), Factored Restricted Boltzmann Machines ({FCRBM}), “shallow” Artificial Neural Networks ({ANN}) and Support Vector Machines ({SVM}) for the same dataset. Experimental results showed that the {CNN} outperformed {SVR} while producing comparable results to the {ANN} and deep learning methodologies. Further testing is required to compare the performances of different deep learning architectures in load forecasting.},
